# Dark Souls Text Controller
Dark Souls is hard. Text-based RPGs from the 90s were hard. This is harder than both!

This program adds a keyboard listener and emulated XBox 360 controller which uses a command map to turn (technically) any game into a text controlled game. Why? Because this is true suffering!


## Installation
Clone this repo, install the dependencies, disable all keyboard/mouse keybinds in your favorite (or least favorite) game, and run!

```
git clone https://github.com/JeremyEudy/darksouls-text-controller

# Preferred: python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

python text-controller.py
```
